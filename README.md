# GAP - A social experiment

By I.C.Captain and Fred Uckerberg

## Manifest

GAP is a value system for driving a post-monetary economy such as the one described in Sacred Economics by Charles Eisenstein.

## Thank you 

In a standard economy of our times, products and services are given in exchange for money. 

So if a gift is received, what is given in exchange? We believe the concept is thankfulness.
